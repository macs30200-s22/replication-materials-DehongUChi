You can find all necessary codes in the file run.ipynb.
Run all of the codes in the file run.ipynb by sequence if you would like to build all of the models.
However, since building random forest models takes a long time, it is suggested to only build models for economic indicators and data type that are of your interest. 

All of the data are located in the repository

Some of the graphs are created using Excel, open results graph.xlsx to access all of the graphs, click on the tab in the bottom of the excel to switch between graphs of models using the top 50 search terms and graphs of models using search topics. 

All of the codes are written in python 3.8.5. 
The version number of all required pakcages: 
Pandas: 1.2.4
Numpy: 1.20.1
Sklearn: 1.0.2
Seaborn: 0.11.1
matplotlib: 3.3.4
